# Serves http://<host>:1420 — first boot shows the backend picker (Jellyfin
# or Plex login; append ?demo=1 for the synthetic demo library, no server
# needed). This runs the
# project's documented server runtime (`npm run serve`: vite preview plus the
# middleware in vite.config.ts), so the Jellyseerr/Romm integration proxy,
# F8 feedback pins and the whole Remote Play stack work — including private
# instances: open /remote.html on a phone or set-top box and the CONTAINER
# renders the store and streams it over WebRTC (use host networking for
# that; see docker-compose.yml). The one host-side feature that stays off
# is local mpv playback, which only ever applies on the HTPC itself.

# Chromium renders Remote Play private instances server-side; coturn relays
# WebRTC for viewers the store can't reach directly (VPN / hostile NAT).
# This layer is ~800MB — most of the image — and it's what makes
# remote.html work on a headless server.
#
# Those private instances render the real 3D store, so they need a GPU mapped
# into the container (`--device /dev/dri`, or the devices: block in
# docker-compose.yml). Without one there is no WebGL in here at all and the
# instance manager refuses with that reason rather than spawning a browser
# that boots to nothing. Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) can't map a GPU, so
# there use the shared mirror from a browser on the host instead.
