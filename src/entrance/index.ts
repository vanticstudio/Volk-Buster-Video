// Entrance airlock. Self-contained fixture: owns the glazed chamber, the
// shield-pentagon counter, the desk CRT rental terminals (whose screen doubles
// as the live search terminal), and the rental bag the launch flourish drops
// movies into.
//
// T05 split this out of a single ~840-line entrance.ts into src/entrance/:
// doors.ts (door style variants), counter.ts (counter style/top variants),
// and this façade, which composes them and keeps its original public surface
// (bagMouthWorld, getSearchCameraPose(), dropIntoBag(), etc. — see
// three-scene.ts's call sites) unchanged so swapping StorefrontSpec doesn't
// ripple outward.
//
// Viewed from above (looking from outside, -Z into the store), the vestibule is
// a square box sitting against the front glass wall (Z = 15):
//
//                 store side (-Z)

//                 street side (+X = right when seen from outside)
//
//  - Front (street, +Z): the reference photo's composition — TWO full-glass
//    aluminum-framed doors ADJACENT at the store centreline, meeting at a
//    center stile, with a narrow (~2 ft) sidelight ("sl") flanking each, and
//    a continuous glass TRANSOM above doors and sidelights running up to the
//    storefront glazing head (WINDOW_HEAD_Y). Exit leaf on the left (-X),
//    entrance leaf on the right (+X).
//  - A glass pane down the centre (X = cx) splits entrance (right) from exit
//    (left).
//  - Right wall (+X): a door from the entrance chamber on into the store.
//  - Left wall (-X): a door letting exiters step from the store into the chamber.
//  - Top wall (-Z): solid; it doubles as the back of the trapezoidal checkout
//    counter (white body, blue top, yellow pinstripe) that faces the store.
