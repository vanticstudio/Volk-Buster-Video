// HERO-RESOLUTION CASE FRONT — the cover art of the case you PICKED UP.
//
// video-case.ts's hero-face block (see HERO_COVER_SCALE) gave every printed face
// of the inspected case a 3x singleton canvas, for the reason spelled out there:
// on the 4K kiosk that case covers ~700x1250 display pixels (and ~975x1780 of the
// supersampled settle frame), so a face drawn at shelf resolution is magnified
// past what its pixels can carry and no amount of framebuffer supersampling
// invents the detail back. Every face got the treatment except one — the retail
// front — because it is not a canvas draw but a decoded poster, and the decode
// was hardcoded to the shelf's 320x480 (that file's own comment: "The retail
// front is a decoded poster and is bounded by that decode ... unaffected by
// this"). So the one face carrying the artwork — the whole point of picking a box
// up — stayed the softest thing on screen, on every quality tier, while the
// rental clamshell beside it was sharp. Owner report, 2026-08-17.
//
// The pixels exist: nothing upstream is throttling them. Jellyfin's poster URL is
// built with no maxWidth (jellyfin.ts buildItemImageUrl), so the source is
// whatever the server holds — commonly 1000x1500 or larger — and even the bundled
// demo posters are 598x874. The 320x480 was only ever the size the SHELVES need,
// where hundreds of covers share a texture array and 256MB pixel budget.
//
// So: decode the same art a second time at HERO_COVER_SCALE, for the one title
// being inspected. That is affordable for exactly the reason the sibling faces
// are — one case is ever inspected at a time — so this module holds a SINGLE
// slot, replaced when the inspected title changes, rather than a per-title cache.
// The decode runs in the existing worker pool off the main thread and reads the
// raw bytes back out of its IndexedDB cache, so it costs no network fetch and no
// main-thread stall; until it lands the caller keeps the shelf-resolution
// material it already had, so the swap is a sharpen in place and there is never
// a blank or placeholder frame.
//
// Kept OUT of video-case.ts deliberately, same as hero-lowres-front.ts next door:
// that file sits at its 6000-line budget (tools/check-file-budget.mjs), and per
// CLAUDE.md hitting the ceiling means extracting, not raising it.

 * The 4K badge, as a fraction of whatever buffer it is stamped onto.
 *
 * Moved here out of the poster queue's decode completion, where it was drawn
 * twice with the geometry hardcoded at each resolution (320x480 and 64x96). The
 * two copies were already the same fractions — 245/320 === 49/64, 400/480 ===
 * 80/96, 35/320 === 7/64 — so folding them into one fraction-based pass is
 * lossless AND makes the badge follow the buffer, which is what lets the hero
 * decode below wear it at 960x1440 instead of losing it.
 *
 * The two deliberate small-buffer exceptions are preserved by the `w >= COVER_WIDTH`
 * tests: the 64x96 layer draws slightly fatter lettering (it is a handful of
 * pixels tall and needs the weight) and skips the border stroke entirely.
 *
 * The buffer is stored bottom-up, hence the negative Y scale on the lettering —
 * the 1.45 is a deliberate stretch on the glyphs, not a buffer correction (see
 * stampCollectionGapSticker, which flips with a pure -1 for that reason).
