// T23 — The rental-mode "home" pocket: where you spend the lockout after
// checking out. Built as a DETACHED POCKET far outside the store shell
// (x +200) so it can never be seen from browsing and never perturbs the
// store's PMREM environment, reflection probes, or night lighting: it is
// created lazily on entry, sits well past the sun's shadow frustum, and its
// only lights are distance-capped point lights that fall to zero long before
// the store.
//
// The old boxed room (walls/ceiling/couch/lamp/door decor) was replaced by a
// studio-style BACKDROP: a flat gradient cyc plane + matching floor (see
// createBackdropTexture — the single swap point for a real photo backdrop).
// What remains is only what the rental fiction needs: the coffee table with
// the rented clamshells (+ receipt), and the TV/deck stack. The set is a PROP,
// not a screen — a tape confirmed here plays fullscreen like every other title
// in the app (owner ruling 2026-08-16), so the tube stays dark glass and the
// only thing the deck does is swallow the tape and hand it back.
//
// Owned by StoreScene (which stays the camera/mode brain); this module owns
// the backdrop, the rented-tape browsing (focus / inspect / flip — the tapes
// are rental clamshells: getRentalCaseGeometry +
// createHeroRentalMaterials), the CRT screen plane, the VCR clock, and every
// tween. update() runs only on composited frames and allocates nothing per
// frame.
//
// Props come from the T24 registry (getPropOrFallback): the set looks right
// with the sized primitive stand-ins and upgrades automatically when the real
// GLBs land in public/models/.

   * The rental receipt on the coffee table — a measured redraw of a real 1995
   * video-store register slip (owner reference, 2026-08-07), replacing the
   * landscape card with a house-colour header band that was here before. That
   * card was invented; this one follows the artifact.
   *
   * What the reference actually is: a narrow impact-printed slip, violet ribbon
   * ink on off-white stock, monospace throughout, no colour and no logo — the
   * header is TYPED, like every other line. Its shape is: transaction number
   * flush right, a centred address block, an asterisk rule, a centred store
   * tagline, a Store/Employee row, a second rule, then line items as PAIRS (an
   * all-caps title line, then an indented kind/price line), a dashed rule
   * before the totals, a `=====` rule before Amount Due, tender and change, the
   * member block, a centred thank-you couplet, a final rule, and a timestamp.
   *
   * Brand rules (CLAUDE.md #2): the wordmark and address come from brand canon,
   * NOT from the photo — same brandString keys the case wrap prints, so a brand
   * pack retitles the receipt with everything else. The reference's own chain
   * slogan is a real mark and does not ship; the tagline is a neutral house
   * line a pack can override.
   *
   * DUE BACK stays, and prints LAST and largest: this prop's diegetic job is
   * telling you when the tape is owed, and rental-clock is what drives the
   * lockout. Everything above it is period dressing.
