// The JUMP INDEX — the store's ONE navigation layer, and what you are in the
// moment the doors close behind you.
//
// It opened from the BOTTOM SHELF ROW until 2026-08-06, when the owner moved it
// onto the pulled-back "choose where to go" views (a jump menu belongs where
// you are already choosing a destination, not one press off the floor in the
// middle of a run). It became the ROOT itself on 2026-08-09: the entrance
// overview used to boot with its own arrow-stepped cursor ring, so you landed
// in one navigation mode and had to press ▼ to reach the real one — two layers
// answering the same question, with ▲ (look up at the store TVs) live in only
// one of them. The cursor ring is gone; store-overview.ts's showOverviewVisuals
// opens this index as the overview's nav layer, and it stays open for as long
// as that view is up. `root: true` marks that instance: Back does not close it
// (there is nothing underneath), and its focus is remembered across a trip into
// an aisle so backing out returns the marker to where you left it.
//
// Two rows, both driven by ←/→ with ▲/▼ switching between them. There is no
// DOM for this (owner call: the indexes are logical, not chrome) — the
// feedback is the store itself plus the SAME single big floating cursor the
// entrance overview and seccam views use (the gold cone + plaque of
// store-camera.ts updateSelectionArrow, which owns the while-index-open
// branch). One marker over the focused destination, exactly as feedback/003
// settled it — never a cloud of per-target signs.
//
//   Row 1  LIBRARIES & GENRES — the checkout counter, every library, the New
//          Releases wall, and the genre sections that PHYSICALLY exist as
//          shelf sections, all in ONE left-to-right run across the store as
//          seen from the vantage (sortByScreenOrder). ◄ and ► move the marker
//          left and right through the room, never through a list order the
//          room can't show you. Genre → location is resolved through the same
//          StorePlan data the overview's genre cursors use
//          (StoreScene.genreCursorTargets → layout.sectionLabels +
//          entryBlockOrder), so a section is listed only when the plan can
//          name the unit/side/column it starts at. An uncategorized store
//          (no genre placards) simply yields none and the row degrades to
//          libraries — no separate code path. This row is viewed from the
//          entrance overview's vantage; stepping it pans ticket-to-ticket.
//   Row 2  DISPLAYS — every slotted floor fixture: genre endcaps, collection
//          endcaps, promo floor stands, bargain bins, drape tables, game
//          gondolas. Moving the highlight GLIDES the camera to face that
//          fixture, so stepping the row is literally walking the displays.
//
// Opened from browse (not the case today, but the open/close contract is
// unchanged): the cursor is untouched while the index is up, the full return
// state is snapshotted on open, and Back restores it exactly. At the ROOT
// there is no such return — Back declines here and store-nav.ts's
// navOverlayBack hands the press to backAction's own floor clamp.
//
// ▲ from Row 1 no longer closes the index (2026-08-06, pin 051): it opens the
// ceiling-TV peek instead (store-tv-peek.ts) — subNavUp here just declines
// (returns false) at row 0, and store-nav.ts's moveUp, the mediator between
// the two overlay modules, is what actually calls enterTvPeek and falls back
// to the old close-on-▲ only when the build has no ambient TVs to peek at.
// The index itself stays open (untouched) the whole time the peek is up;
// subNavRefresh below is what the peek's exit hands control back to.
//
// Everything here is keypress-driven; nothing runs per frame (the arrow's
// bob is the selection arrow's own animate handling, shared with every other
// mode that shows it).
