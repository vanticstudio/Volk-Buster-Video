// The harness's URL-param -> localStorage seeding, split out of harness.ts so
// it can run EARLIER than harness.ts does.
//
// Why it has to: harness.ts builds its StoreScene straight down the module
// body, so harness-boot.ts awaits the async pre-boot work (fonts, brand pack)
// BEFORE importing it. Anything those awaits read out of localStorage must
// therefore already be written — and `?set=bb_brand_pack=<id>` is exactly
// that: read by loadBrandPack(), written by this file. With the seeding still
// inside harness.ts the pack was looked up before the shot tool's --set had
// landed, and every pack screenshot silently came out as the built-in brand.
//
// Pure localStorage writes, no imports: whatever pulls this in must not drag
// the scene graph into the boot shim's chunk. Idempotent — harness.ts calls it
// again for the non-shim path, and re-writing the same values is free.
