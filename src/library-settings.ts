// Per-library settings, registered DYNAMICALLY once a catalog is known —
// unlike every static row in settings.ts, these can't exist until a server
// (or the demo) has told us what libraries there are. Two families share the
// mechanism:
//
//  - STORE LIBRARIES (#41, Settings → Connection → Store Libraries): which
//    libraries this store carries as aisles. Default ON; switching one off
//    skips its item sync entirely on the next boot (see excludeLibraryIds in
//    fetchJellyfinLibrariesAndMovies). First set on the opening-day setup
//    terminal's checkbox screen; editable from the drawer after. These rows
//    register from the REMEMBERED full server list (below), not the loaded
//    catalog — an excluded library is absent from the catalog by design, and
//    its row must survive so it can be switched back on.
//
//  - OVERHEAD TVS (#39, Settings → Playback → Overhead TVs): which libraries
//    feed the ceiling CRTs' playback pool (ambient-tvs.ts). Default OFF for
//    every row — none selected means the family-genre heuristic keeps picking,
//    so existing stores don't change behavior. These rows register from the
//    CURRENT catalog (a pool can only draw from stock that's actually in the
//    store — and in the demo that's the demo libraries).
//
// Value reads go through raw localStorage scans rather than getSetting():
// the carried-set is needed at sync time, BEFORE any registration has run on
// a fresh boot, and the TV pool is read inside the harness-booted scene where
// main.ts never registers anything. Keys are stable per library id, so a
// choice survives re-syncs and member switches.
//
// MULTI-SOURCE (GH #84): a library id is only unique within its own server —
// Plex section keys are small integers, so "1" naming a different library on
// each of two servers is the normal case, not a freak collision. Ids are
// therefore namespaced `<sourceId>:<libId>` everywhere above the provider, and
// these keys follow. Keys written before #84 are BARE, and resolving them is
// what keeps an existing store's choices: a bare key belongs to the primary
// source, and a namespaced key for the same library always wins over it.
