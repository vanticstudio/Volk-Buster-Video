// NEW STORE SETUP (#41) — the CONTROLLER behind the opening-day counter
// terminal. The empty store boots, the camera docks at the checkout CRT (the
// manager-terminal camera dock), and this flow walks the player from "bare
// shelves" to a stocked store: distributor row → server address typed on the
// CRT → membership card pick (the existing DOM picker; CRT sign-in when the
// server lists no public users) → library checkbox rows (which aisles this
// store carries, persisted via library-settings) → streaming-service
// checkbox rows (GH #86 zero-setup follow-up, owner ruling 2026-08-21: which
// streaming apps the player has, persisted to bb_streaming_services -- blank
// stays this local install's default of NO streaming aisles) → FIRST
// SHIPMENT ARRIVING.
//
// Same split as counter-terminal-flow.ts: the screens themselves are pure
// (store-setup-screens.ts, unit-tested); this file is only glue — render onto
// the scene's CRT, route remote presses and typed keys, run the Jellyfin
// calls, persist choices, and hand the stocked-store launch back to
// boot-flow.ts through the callbacks it was initialized with.
