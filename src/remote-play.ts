// Remote Play — server-side rendering as a store feature.
//
// The machine running the store IS the render server: this module captures
// the live WebGL canvas with captureStream() plus the SFX master bus
// (audio.ts), and streams both peer-to-peer over WebRTC to any /remote.html
// viewer on the network. Viewer keyboard/mouse input comes back on the data
// channel and is replayed as synthetic DOM events, so it flows through the
// exact same InputManager / walk-look / clasp-click paths as local input.
// The handshake goes through the dev/preview server's HTTP mailbox
// (remotePlaySignalPlugin in vite.config.ts); media never touches the server.
//
// Costs nothing while idle by construction: captureStream() only produces
// frames when the render-on-demand loop actually paints, so an idle store
// streams no video, and the encoder (hardware, via WebRTC) sleeps with it.
//
// Enabled with the bb_remote_play setting (Connection group) or ?remote=1.

//
// Everything below dispatches REAL DOM events so remote input takes the same
// code paths as local input (InputManager on window, walk mouse-look on
// window, clasp picking on the renderer canvas) — no parallel input API to
// keep in sync.

// ─── Virtual gamepad (a viewer's physical controller) ───────────────────────
//
// A controller paired to the VIEWER's device is polled viewer-side and its raw
// standard-mapping state arrives here as {t:'pad'}. We surface it as a synthetic
// entry in navigator.getGamepads() so the store's OWN pad readers consume it
// exactly as a local pad, in every mode, with no parallel input path:
//   InputManager.pollGamepad (menus/2D)  and  StoreScene walk-mode analog sticks.
// The host machine itself has no pad, so this is the only way a remote viewer's
// controller can drive movement/look or reach the action buttons.
