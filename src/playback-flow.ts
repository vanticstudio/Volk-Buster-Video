// Extracted from main.ts, which sits at its enforced line budget: the mpv
// exit handler needed the same "did this end naturally, and if so what's
// next" logic the in-app HTML5 player's onClose already had, and mpv itself
// needed the local file handed off to it (playLocalWithMpv) to actually gain
// resume, next-episode autoplay, and the Settings ▸ Playback language/caption
// preferences the HTML5 path already honored. Moving playLocalWithMpv here
// wholesale — rather than just adding params to it in place — is what pays
// for those three features without growing main.ts at all.
// Explicit .ts specifiers: tests/playback-flow.test.ts loads this module
// under `node --test`'s type-stripping loader, which can't resolve a bare
// sibling specifier (same note as jellyfin.ts's own media-release-date.ts import).
