// Which localStorage keys are STORE CONFIGURATION, and what happens to them —
// the decision half of GH #123, split from the transport half so it can be
// tested (see tests/store-config-keys.test.ts).
//
// Deliberately has NO imports, same reason as media-source-provider.ts and
// seerr-config.ts: it must run under `node --test` type-stripping, and its
// sibling store-config-sync.ts drags in a provider, which drags in Tauri and
// DOM globals a test process cannot load. localStorage is reached as a global
// and guarded, so a DOM-less caller gets empty results rather than a throw.
//
// This is the file to edit when a new setting must (or must not) follow a
// person between machines. The rationale for each exclusion lives with it —
// the whole point of an explicit skip-set is that the argument is written
// down where the next person changing it will read it.
