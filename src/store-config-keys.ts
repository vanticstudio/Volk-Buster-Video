// Which localStorage keys are STORE CONFIGURATION, and what happens to them —
// the decision half of GH #123, split from the transport half so it can be
// tested (see tests/store-config-keys.test.ts).
//
// Deliberately has NO imports, same reason as media-source-provider.ts and
// seerr-config.ts: it must run under `node --test` type-stripping, and its
// sibling store-config-sync.ts drags in a provider, which drags in Tauri and
// DOM globals a test process cannot load. localStorage is reached as a global
// and guarded, so a DOM-less caller gets empty results rather than a throw.
//
// This is the file to edit when a new setting must (or must not) follow a
// person between machines. The rationale for each exclusion lives with it —
// the whole point of an explicit skip-set is that the argument is written
// down where the next person changing it will read it.

 * placement removes rather than papers over with a "keep in step" comment.
 *

 *
 * HERE, in the zero-import leaf, because more than one module needs it and the

 * era was written out as a literal in three separate modules in this codebase

// bb_viewer_only is a flag the FRONT DOOR writes into every served page, but

// flip it and see the owner's settings drawer. That is ACCEPTED, and the
// reason is the threat model this fork already states: the real boundary is
// Plex's sharing (unshare a person and the front door stops serving them),
// and the drawer's knobs are store-look preferences, not credentials — keys,
// hostnames and admin writes live server-side precisely so a client flag can
// never reach them. Hiding the drawer from a viewer is courtesy, not access
// control: the same person can also read the served JS and call the store's
// own APIs directly. If that ever stops being the posture (untrusted members
// of the public reaching :3355), the flag must move from localStorage to a
// server-side session claim the front door asserts per document load — a
// claim the viewer cannot edit, enforced where the settings drawer opens.
