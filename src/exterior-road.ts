// edge instead of letting the lot's asphalt plane end in a hard cut against
// the sky pano's photographed ground — or, per the #144 attempt this
// replaces, a wide gray alpha fade that read as a fog bank / under-lit halo
// rather than pavement. A modeled road (asphalt lane, curb + gutter, dashed
// centerline) gives the lot a plausible object to end AT; only the road's
// own outer edge, and (behind the bare curb) the lot's two side edges, still
// get a ground-blend.ts seam fade — narrowed way down from #144's 16 ft ring
// to a couple of feet, since blending a flat tinted quad over photo detail
// reads as haze at any width, it's just imperceptible once narrow enough.
//
// Every mesh here is static (materials swap on setGroundColor, nothing
// per-frame) and merges into whichever parent group the caller passes,
// riding that group's existing exterior env-map dimming pass for free.
