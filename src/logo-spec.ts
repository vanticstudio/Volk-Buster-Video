// emblem, shelf/library labels, overhead signage (and, in later phases, box
// wraps and the extruded 3D sign) are all painted from one of these specs
// instead of hardcoded drawing, so users can design their own video-store
// brand — or, with a brand pack (src/brand-pack.ts), drop in a whole traced
// identity without touching code.
//
// NO three.js imports here: this module is consumed by pure-canvas painters
// (logo-renderer.ts) and, later, by the settings-UI form, neither of which
// needs the 3D stack.
//
// The runtime dependency is one-directional — themes.ts imports the default
// specs from here to embed as `theme.brand.logo`; this file only imports the
// StoreTheme TYPE (erased at compile time), so there is no import cycle.
