// Which FILE a brand font name actually paints in.
//
// The brand editor's family picker (settings.ts BRAND_FONTS) stores display
// names, and two of them used to arrive only over a Google-Fonts @import in
// styles.css — i.e. never on an offline kiosk boot, where the emblem then
// painted in whatever the system sans is and nothing said so. Both are now
// bundled (and that @import is gone as of 2026-08-06), so the picker's name
// maps onto the shipped file. The stored spec keeps the human name; only the
// canvas font string changes.
//
// Anton and Bebas Neue were bundled with the others but were once missing from
// the map below, so picking either in the editor painted the emblem in the
// system sans — the exact silent substitution this map exists to stop. Every
// family the picker offers must resolve to a shipped file; adding a name to
// BRAND_FONTS below without adding it here is the bug to watch for.
//
// This lives in its own module (rather than inside logo-renderer.ts, where it
// started) because the emblem composer's text layers need the same answer, and
// two copies of this map is precisely the trap described above with a second
// place to forget.
