 * `/:/timeline` is the endpoint every Plex-API write-up names, and it is the
 * wrong one here: it belongs to a live play-queue session (it wants
 * playQueueItemID and the session state machine), and answers 400 to a client
 * that is simply reporting where the viewer got to — verified against 1.43.3,
 * with and without the documented parameter set. `/:/progress` sets viewOffset
 * and `/:/scrobble` sets viewCount, which is exactly the two pieces of state
 * the store reads back as `resumePositionTicks` and `played`.
