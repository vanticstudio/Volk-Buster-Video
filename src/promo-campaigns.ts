//
// A floor stand runs ONE campaign. A campaign is a content selector + a sign +
// (where it matters) a rating band. Its four faces may subdivide the campaign —
// PREVIOUSLY VIEWED gives a face to each library — but they never carry
// unrelated subjects, because a real four-sided tower shouted one thing from
// every side; that is the entire point of being four-sided.
//
// This replaces the old "each face is a different Jellyfin BoxSet" content
// rule. Collections were the wrong thing to put here twice over: most BoxSets
// are two titles, which left seven of a face's nine slots bare under a
// full-size sign, and video stores never grouped the floor by taxonomy at all.
// Collections stay handled where they already were — members file adjacent on
// the shelf (shelfTitleCompare in store-layout, and store-plan keeps a saga
// from being split across category sections).
//
// Everything below selects from data the Jellyfin sync already carries:
// `played`/`lastPlayedDate`, `studios`, `rating` (OfficialRating), `genres`,
// `overview`. Nothing here fetches.
