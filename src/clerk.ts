/**
 * StoreClerk — a Doom-style directional 2D billboard clerk.
 *
 * She has a real world HEADING (independent of the camera). Each frame we pick
 * one of five drawn views — front / front-side / side / back-side / back —
 * based on the angle between her heading and the direction to the camera, and
 * mirror horizontally for the opposite three octants. The quad still billboards
 * to face the camera (THREE.Sprite); only the *drawn view* changes.
 *
 * The character art (a stylized female retail clerk: brunette bob, house polo +
 * nametag, khakis, black sneakers) is generated procedurally on a canvas — see
 * `src/clerk-art.ts`, which owns the whole sprite sheet: the two-bone limb rig,
 * per-part shading, silhouette outlining and the painted face. This class owns
 * only her behavior (navigation, stocking/idle/chat state) and the runtime
 * view-picking that pages the atlas.
 *
 * Atlas grid (from clerk-art): rows = direction (5), columns = every animation
 * frame concatenated left-to-right (idle 2 · walk 4 · stockHigh 2 · stockMid 2
 * · stockLow 2 · talk 2 · type 2 = 16).
 *
 * Navigation is grid-based (src/clerk-nav.ts): the scene hands the
 * constructor an occupancy grid built from the store's real ground-plan
 * footprints, and every trip is an A* route through it — she physically walks
 * around shelving, fixtures, and the counter (entering it only through its
 * real walk-through gap) instead of following hardcoded waypoints.
