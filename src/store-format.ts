// STORE FORMAT PRESETS — the store's *personality*, one level above a theme.
//
// A THEME (src/themes.ts) changes finishes: paint, carpet colour, topper style,
// which era's signage set hangs on the walls. Every theme lays the same store
// out the same way, because a theme cannot move a wall.
//
// A FORMAT changes the GEOMETRY RULES. It decides how wide the aisles are, how
// tall the shelving runs, how the floor plan grows as the library grows, how
// low the ceiling sits, which fixtures the format even admits. Two formats ship:
//
//   corporate    — the big chain box this app was built as. Herringbone-capable
//                  aisle fields flanking a wide central walkway, 13.5 ft ceiling,
//                  five-tier gondolas, floor displays, a wall of New Releases.
//
// That is the only format this build carries. Upstream also shipped
// 'mom-and-pop', a cramped neighbourhood store with tighter runs, taller wood
// shelving and a standalone desk; it was removed on request. Field comments
// below still cite its numbers, deliberately — they are what shows the useful
// RANGE of each field, and they are the reference for anyone adding a second
// fit-out later.
//                  Behind a beaded curtain at the back is the small curtained-off
//                  section every one of these stores had.
//
// WHY THIS IS DATA AND NOT A BRANCH: the corporate spec below holds *today's
// literal constants*, so store-layout.ts derives its exported geometry from
// `activeStoreFormat()` and the default store is unchanged, value for value.
// A third format is a new entry in FORMATS, not a new `if` in the floor planner.
//
// ── WHEN THE FORMAT IS RESOLVED, AND WHY IT MATTERS ─────────────────────────
// ONCE, at module-evaluation time, from localStorage — the same moment
// store-layout.ts's own constants are computed. That is deliberate and it is
// the whole reason this module imports nothing at runtime.
//
// store-layout.ts derives module-level constants FROM the shelf-tier count
// (UNIT_SIDE_CAPACITY, UNIT_CAPACITY, SECTION_CAPACITY, TINY_LIBRARY_MOVIES),
// and a dozen modules capture those at import time. If the format could change
// after modules loaded, those constants would go stale against a live shelf
// geometry that no longer matched them — a store whose planner believes a unit
// face holds 60 cases while the unit physically has 108 slots. So switching
// format is a RELOAD (see the bb_store_format setting's applyMode), not a
// scene rebuild, and nothing in the app is allowed to mutate the active format
// in place.
//
// Anything that wants to choose a format must therefore write
// localStorage BEFORE the module graph is imported — which is exactly what the
// front door's instance seeding does when it hydrates a viewer's config ahead
// of the app's own module body.
