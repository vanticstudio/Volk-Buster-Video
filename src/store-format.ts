// STORE FORMAT PRESETS — the store's *personality*, one level above a theme.
//
// A THEME (src/themes.ts) changes finishes: paint, carpet colour, topper style,
// which era's signage set hangs on the walls. Every theme lays the same store
// out the same way, because a theme cannot move a wall.
//
// A FORMAT changes the GEOMETRY RULES. It decides how wide the aisles are, how
// tall the shelving runs, how the floor plan grows as the library grows, how
// low the ceiling sits, which fixtures the format even admits. Two formats ship:
//
//   corporate    — the big chain box this app was built as. Herringbone-capable
//                  aisle fields flanking a wide central walkway, 13.5 ft ceiling,
//                  five-tier gondolas, floor displays, a wall of New Releases.
//
//   mom-and-pop  — the cramped neighbourhood store (GH #33). Straight runs only,
//                  packed at a 4 ft aisle pitch across ONE field with no central
//                  walkway; wood shelving that runs floor-to-ceiling under a
//                  9 ft ceiling; brown shag on the floor; no floor displays and
//                  no New Releases wall — the walls belong to the regular
//                  library and new releases get at most one run of their own.
//                  Behind a beaded curtain at the back is the small curtained-off
//                  section every one of these stores had.
//
// WHY THIS IS DATA AND NOT A BRANCH: the corporate spec below holds *today's
// literal constants*, so store-layout.ts derives its exported geometry from
// `activeStoreFormat()` and the default store is unchanged, value for value.
// A third format is a new entry in FORMATS, not a new `if` in the floor planner.
//
// ── WHEN THE FORMAT IS RESOLVED, AND WHY IT MATTERS ─────────────────────────
// ONCE, at module-evaluation time, from localStorage — the same moment
// store-layout.ts's own constants are computed. That is deliberate and it is
// the whole reason this module imports nothing at runtime.
//
// store-layout.ts derives module-level constants FROM the shelf-tier count
// (UNIT_SIDE_CAPACITY, UNIT_CAPACITY, SECTION_CAPACITY, TINY_LIBRARY_MOVIES),
// and a dozen modules capture those at import time. If the format could change
// after modules loaded, those constants would go stale against a live shelf
// geometry that no longer matched them — a store whose planner believes a unit
// face holds 60 cases while the unit physically has 108 slots. So switching
// format is a RELOAD (see the bb_store_format setting's applyMode), not a
// scene rebuild, and nothing in the app is allowed to mutate the active format
// in place.
//
// The harness gets this for free: harness-params.ts seeds localStorage from the
// URL inside harness-boot.ts, strictly before `import('./harness')` pulls in the
// scene graph — so `--set bb_store_format=mom-and-pop` lands before store-layout
// evaluates. Same contract as `?set=bb_brand_pack=<id>`.
