// Bundled display faces — the ONLY faces canvas painters are allowed to name.
//
// Every sign in this store is measured against the face it declares: cap
// heights, ink widths and letter gaps all come out of measureText. Naming a
// family the host does not have does not fail — the browser silently
// substitutes another face and every one of those measurements is quietly
// wrong (that is how blue-diamond-special-2-sticker shipped copy through its
// keyline; see tools/font-resolution.mjs). So the rule is: name a face we
// SHIP, never a face we hope is installed.
//
// The proprietary faces this store's signage kept asking for are not
// installable here, so the owner ruled on free stand-ins of the same class
// (2026-08-02):
//   Impact       -> Anton         (ultra-condensed heavy grotesque, Impact class)
//   Arial Black  -> Archivo Black (heavy grotesque, Arial-Black class)
//   Segoe Script /
//   Brush Script -> Yellowtail    (retro connected brush script)
// plus Outfit and Orbitron, which the tech-spec panels already named but which
// used to arrive only over a Google-Fonts @import in styles.css — i.e. never at
// all on a boot with no network, which is the normal state of an HTPC kiosk.
// That @import is gone (2026-08-06): styles.css now declares @font-face against
// these same bundled files, so the DOM and the canvas load from one source.
//
// Loading follows the shape ensureBrandFont (canvas-textures.ts) and
// ensureVarsityFont (fixtures/genre-fascia.ts) already use: register the
// bundled file as a FontFace under a BB-prefixed family name, so nothing can
// collide with a same-named system family or with the stylesheet's webfont
// copy, and repaint in place when it lands. No network fetch: Vite inlines
// these as bundle assets.
