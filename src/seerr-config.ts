// Which request server the store talks to, and whether one is configured at
// all. Kept as its own module with NO imports — not even a type import — so it
// runs under `node --test` type-stripping (tests/seerr-config.test.ts); the
// client that uses it (jellyseerr.ts) drags in Tauri and DOM globals that a
// test process can't load.
//
// The integration speaks the *Overseerr* API — `X-Api-Key`, `/api/v1/request`,
// `/api/v1/discover/*`, `/api/v1/movie/{tmdbId}` — which Jellyseerr inherited
// wholesale as a fork, so one client serves both (GH #50). The stored key
// stays `jellyseerr_*`, because that is what every existing install already
// has on disk; `seerr_*` and `overseerr_*` are accepted as aliases so an
// Overseerr user isn't asked to fill in a box named after the other fork.
//
// Worth knowing which way round this goes: Overseerr is Plex-only and
// Jellyseerr is the fork that added Jellyfin/Emby, so pointing this at a real
// Overseerr is only useful alongside a Plex library (GH #32) or in a
// dual-stack household. The wire protocol is identical either way, which is
// why the plumbing can land ahead of any library support.
