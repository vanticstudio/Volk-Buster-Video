// This module is the part the 3D harness also needs (it boots StoreScene
// without main.ts's DOM shell), so the row text lives here as pure data +
// a pure formatter rather than inside main.ts.
// Brand seam: the one branded row (CLOSE <BRAND> APP) reads through a late-
// bound resolver instead of importing brand-pack, which drags DOM-flavored
// modules behind it and would break this file's node-testability — the whole
// reason the row text lives here (see header). brand-pack.ts installs the
// real brandString at its module eval (it is loaded before any CRT draws);
// until then, and in node tests, the fallback literal is the answer — which
// is exactly brandString's own behavior with no pack loaded.
