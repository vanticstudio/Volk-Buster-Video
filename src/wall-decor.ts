// Actor-portrait wall + floating film-strip ribbon — pin 052 rebuild
// (feedback/052, GitHub issue #25), widened 2026-08 to span all three back
// walls (feedback: "the actor posters... are supposed to span the entire
// back three walls with the film strip. not just a tiny portion of one").
//
// The previous version of this feature (deleted from store-shell.ts) hung a
// fixed-size row of movie posters + a "mural" band at a hardcoded width/Z,
// sized off nothing but its own entry.width — so on any store deep/shallow
// enough it clipped straight through the EXIT door, its frame, and the side
// window ribbon. Owner verdict: "looks terrible and makes no sense... should
// NEVER CLIP with other objects especially like this."
//
// This version:
//  - Only builds on the high-ceiling variant (bb_ceiling=high): that's the
//    only shell with a tall wall band above the door/window line to hang
//    anything in. The gate lives HERE (not just in the shell spec) so it
//    can't drift out of sync with the setting that actually grew the wall.
//  - Computes EACH of the three back walls' (left, back, right) CLEAR
//    run(s) from the real shell geometry before placing anything: the
//    side window ribbon (shared/mirrored on both left and right — see
//    buildSideWall in store-shell.ts, which draws both from the same
//    scene.sideRibbon span), the service door + EXIT sign (right wall
//    only, shared from storefront-facade.ts, the same numbers the door
//    itself is built from), and the stepped back-right corner's short
//    perpendicular connector face — which is NOT one of the three named
//    walls, so it stays undecorated and simply splits the back/right runs
//    apart when the step is present. Obstacles are excluded, never
//    overlapped, and a wall breaks into per-span segments if it produces
//    more than one clear run — see computeClearSpans/planPortraitSlots.
//  - The three walls' bands read as ONE continuous run around the two
//    corners they actually share (left-back always; back-right too when
//    the store has no stepped corner): each side butts its span right up
//    to the OTHER wall's own flush-mounted plane (WALL_INSET, not the
//    bigger CORNER_MARGIN breathing room reserved for corners with no
//    décor on the other side, e.g. the step notch or the ribbon/door) so
//    the two perpendicular planes meet edge-to-edge with no gap and no
//    poke-through.
//  - Content is the library's actual most-featured actors: tallies
//    Movie.castPeople (top-billed cast, Jellyfin Person id + portrait image)
//    across every library, keeps only people with a real portrait image, and
//    takes the top MAX_PORTRAITS by appearance count, evenly spread across
//    every wall's spans in proportion to their length. Zero qualifying
//    actors (e.g. the synthetic demo/harness catalog, which has no Person
//    image data) still gets the film strip — just no portraits, per spec
//    ("zero = just the film strip").
//  - The film strip is CONSTRUCTED as the object it is — sprocket-hole rails
//    along both edges, frame lines dividing cells — not a blur or a generic
//    stripe (owner's tone-on-tone-ghost-art rule). Its accent color pulls
//    from the active theme's palette instead of a hardcoded house red.

// was asked so the two never silently become one number.
// What the band actually is, measured off a built store rather than guessed
// (traverse of every mesh near the back wall, world-space bounding boxes, 1993

//
//   7.20   top of the New Releases wall stock (last shelf tier + a leaning case)

//  13.10   upper wall band (blue valance + bulb run), the whole wall's width
//  15.30   visible ceiling line (the mirror cornice's bottom edge)
//
// Two hard objects, one soft one. The valance and the stock are geometry and
// the décor stays out of both. The lettering is PAINT, and a frame standing

// third; the ask reads as "move them up", but the probe above says they cannot
// go up — their tops already sit 0.01 ft under the valance. So the ribbon comes
