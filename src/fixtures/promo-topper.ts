// Header signs for the four-sided promo floor stands.
//
// These used to be 2.25 ft 16:9 billboards — a Jellyfin backdrop, a poster
// inset and a name band, one per face, standing a foot and a half over the
// stand. Far too big: nothing in the store hung a lightbox that size over a
// floor fixture, and four of them turned a display into a kiosk. What a stand
// actually wore was the small header the shelf runs wear.
//
// EVERY theme gets the 1993 fascia blade — the colored band in white varsity
// block letters. This is a deliberate exception to the rule shelving.ts
// follows (section signs track the active theme's `topperStyle`): the stands
// briefly did track it, wearing the 1990 signboard, the 2000 arched plaque and
// the 2010 flush banner in their own eras, and the blade simply looked best on
// this fixture in all of them. User's call, on the built result.
//
// The blade is hung in the HOUSE colorway, not the 1993 genre-color system the
// aisle blades use. A promo stand's header prints a CAMPAIGN name ("HOLIDAY
// FAVORITES", "PREVIOUSLY VIEWED"), not a genre, so there is no genre family to
// look up — bb93GenreColor fell through to its default and printed the same
// blue on every stand. That was invisible while the house itself was navy and
// became the one off-palette object in an emerald room the moment the brand
// moved. Deriving from the active theme means the stands follow the house (and
// an installed brand pack) the way every other sign already does.
