// TRANSITIONAL LOW-RES CASE FRONT — what a hovered box wears for the ~3 frames
// between "its full-res pixels aren't cached" and "the re-decode landed".
//
// Since the poster caches were re-bounded (256MB full-res, wave 2), boot decodes
// every title through posterPixelCache and then evicts all but the newest ~435,
// so on any library bigger than that the FIRST hover of nearly every title is a
// full-res cache miss. getPosterMaterial's miss path fell straight through to
// sharedJellyfinFrontPlaceholderMaterial — a flat #0f172a fill — which against
// the store's white shelving reads as the case flashing solid BLACK for ~47ms
// before the real cover pops in (owner report, 2026-08-06; reproduced at 10/10
// hovers on a 1400-title catalog, 0/10 on a 400-title one that fits the budget).
//
// The art to show instead is already in memory, in TWO places of very different
// size:
//  - lowResCache (video-case.ts) is a 64MB budget of 64x96 thumbnails
//    (24,576 B/title ~ 2,700 titles) — cheap, and checked first below.
//  - textureArrayManager (poster-textures.ts) never evicts: once a layer is
//    uploaded it lives on the GPU (and in its CPU mirror) for the life of the
//    scene. On a catalog that outgrows lowResCache too (or just outpaces it —
//    a background sweep, loadAllArtworkForActiveLibrary, decodes the whole
//    library regardless of where the browse cursor is, so titles the cursor
//    reaches late routinely age out of BOTH small CPU caches before they're
//    ever hovered) this is the ONLY tier still holding the title's pixels.
//    Confirmed still-reproducible after the lowResCache-only version of this
//    fix landed: scratch/hoverflicker2.mjs on a 1400-title catalog shows
//    hasArt()/hasHighRes() true with BOTH CPU caches missed, past ~move 18 of
//    a browse sweep — exactly the flat-placeholder case again.
//
// Both tiers are decoded from the same source, through the same medium mode,
// and carry the same gap/staff-pick stamps as the full-res pixels — so the
// transitional frame is always the title's OWN cover (sometimes low-res,
// sometimes even the sharper 160x240 GPU layer), which reads as the box
// sharpening rather than as a black flash.
//
// Kept OUT of video-case.ts deliberately: that file sits at its 6000-line budget
// (tools/check-file-budget.mjs), and per CLAUDE.md hitting the ceiling means
// extracting, not raising it.
//
// Two call-site notes, since the video-case diff is now nearly comment-free:
//  - The miss path lives in getPosterMaterial, so EVERY consumer of it (hero
//    inspect case, person endcaps, decor fixtures, the degenerate race its own
//    comment describes) gets the soft cover, not just the hovered box.
//  - createHeroJellyfinMaterials' old `posterPixelCache.has()` gate is gone
//    with it. That gate was independently wrong: it showed the flat placeholder
//    whenever the CPU pixels had been evicted even if this title's full-res
//    GPU texture was still live in heroPosterTextureLRU or pinned, so a case
//    could flash black with its real texture sitting right there unused.
